matlab-utils
============

The purpose of this module is to incorporate some functionality into matlab.

The module can be imported by typing something like:
  
  utils = getUtils;

After including, 'utils' becomes a struct of functions and organized submodules in several categories. Calling syntax for any of the included functions looks like:

  newarray = utils.std.reverse(array);
